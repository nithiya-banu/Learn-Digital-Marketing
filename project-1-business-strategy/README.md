Digital Marketing Strategy Draft for a Local Business

## Elevator Pitch

Created a 5-pillar digital marketing strategy for a local business.

## How I built it

1. Selected a business (Nuva Jewels) and wrote a short description.
2. Picked one digital tactic for each pillar: SEO, Social Media, Content, Email, Paid Ads.
3. Explained why each tactic fits the business.
4. Compiled everything into a 1-page strategy document (strategy.docx).

## Results

Ready-to-implement roadmap for client discussions.

## Demo Script (30–60s)

Hi, I built a simple digital marketing strategy for a local business. It includes SEO ideas like ranking for ‘affordable antique jewelry,’ social media tactics like Instagram Reels, and an ad plan to target people interested in jewelry. This kind of roadmap is what I can create for any small business to grow online.
